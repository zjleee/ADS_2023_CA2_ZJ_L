# File Management

## Project Description
A file management system that allows users to view, retrieve and remove files and folders from a Tree data structure that is loaded and validated from an XML file using SFML.
It can:
- Determine the number of items (Files or folders) within a given folder directory
- Determine the amount of memory used by a given folder.
- Prune the tree to remove empty folders
- Find a given file/folder given a partial or complete filename (no path) and generate the path for the given file/folder
- Display the contents of a given folder including the size of files

## Issues
- Testing for XML validation fails
